# Advent of code 2022

My take on the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), It may never be completed and is way behind the current published puzzle.

I decided to give F# a try - never used it much before. Please expect no perfect solutions but instead you may be able to see my struggles with FÃ¤ ;)
